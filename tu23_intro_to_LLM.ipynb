    " The field of AI comprises of many types of systems. In broad strokes though, we can simplify the types of AI into two main types. **Traditional AI** (a.k.a., weak AI) and **Generative AI**. [See this short article from the U.S. Chambers of Commerce](https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/technology/traditional-ai-vs-generative-ai). In a nutshell, Traditional and Generative AI represent two different paradigms within the field of artificial intelligence, each with its own approach to solving problems and generating intelligent behavior.\n",

    "AI is part of a large set of work that comprises many sub-discipline, models and an algorithms. Below is a short list of the few types of concepts that are helpful to understand AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning**: Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms can improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning**: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers (hence the term \"deep\"). Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLP is a branch of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP techniques are used in applications such as chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computer Vision**: Computer vision is another subfield of AI concerned with enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. Computer vision algorithms can analyze images and videos, detect objects and patterns, and make decisions based on visual input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robotics**: Robotics combines elements of AI, machine learning, and mechanical engineering to design and develop robots that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robots equipped with AI capabilities can navigate their environments, manipulate objects, and interact with humans and other robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expert Systems**: Expert systems are AI systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific domain. They use a knowledge base of facts and rules to provide advice or solve problems within their area of expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, allowing it to learn optimal behavior through trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, AI encompasses a broad range of techniques, algorithms, and applications aimed at creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. Its potential impact spans across various industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, entertainment, and beyond.\n",

Instead of reading a sentence from start to finish, transformers can focus on important words and relationships between them, just like how a student might focus on key concepts in a lesson.

    "Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a series of transformer-based language models developed by OpenAI. GPT models are designed for natural language understanding and generation tasks, including text completion, question answering, summarization, translation, and more. The key characteristics of GPT models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pre-training:* GPT models are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data from diverse sources, such as books, articles, websites, and other textual sources. During pre-training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding context. This process enables the model to capture rich semantic information and linguistic patterns from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Generative Capability:* GPT models are generative in nature, meaning they can generate human-like text based on a given prompt or context. Given an input prompt, the model generates a continuation of text that is coherent and contextually relevant, drawing upon its knowledge of language acquired during pre-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fine-tuning:* While GPT models are initially pre-trained on a large corpus of text data, they can be further fine-tuned on task-specific datasets to adapt their knowledge and capabilities to specific applications. Fine-tuning allows GPT models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and language translation."

    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "A prompt is a piece of text provided as input to a generative LLM to elicit a specific response. It serves as the initial context or instruction for the model to generate text. The prompt typically contains some initial information or a question that guides the LLM in generating a coherent and relevant response. It can be tailored to the specific task or application, providing context and constraints for the generated text. In code writing, a prompt could be a partial code snippet or a description of a programming problem, instructing the LLM to generate the remaining code or a solution. For example, a prompt might be \"Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query:**\n",
    "A query refers to a request or question posed to the generative LLM, typically in the form of text input. Queries are used to solicit responses from the LLM based on specific information or instructions provided by the user. In code writing tasks, a query could be a programming-related question or a problem statement, prompting the LLM to generate code snippets or solutions. For instance, a query might be \"Implement a function to sort an array of integers in ascending order.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "A response is the output generated by the generative LLM in reaction to a given prompt or query. It represents the text or code generated by the model. Responses provide answers, solutions, or generated text based on the input provided to the LLM. The quality and relevance of the response depend on the model's training data, architecture, and parameters. In code writing tasks, a response could be a complete code snippet generated by the LLM based on the prompt or query. For instance, if the prompt is \"Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number,\" the response might be the corresponding Python code for factorial calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokens:**\n",
    "Tokens are the smallest units of text or code that the generative LLM processes and generates. Tokens can represent words, subwords, or characters depending on the tokenization strategy used. Tokens serve as the building blocks of text generation and understanding in LLMs. They enable the model to capture semantic meaning, syntax, and structure of the input and generated text. In code writing tasks, tokens could represent individual programming keywords, identifiers, operators, or punctuation symbols. For instance, in Python code, tokens could include words like \"def\" (for defining functions), \"if\" (for conditional statements), and \"return\" (for returning values), as well as variable names and numeric literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an overview, prompts provide initial context or instructions, queries solicit specific responses, responses are the generated output, and tokens represent the smallest units of text or code processed by the LLM.
