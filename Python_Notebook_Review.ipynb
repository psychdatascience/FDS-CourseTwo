    "# FDS II Jupyter Notebook Review\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "One of the things that can confuse newcomers that wish to dabble in Python is the huge variety of options – not options for Python *per se*, but options for how to interact with Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you use R, then you almost certainly use RStudio as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment); it's pretty much the only game in town. If you use MATLAB, then you use the MATLAB IDE, full stop. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Python, by contrast, there are a dizzying array of options; you can program in Python using \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python in the terminal, \n",
    "* iPython in the terminal, \n",
    "* IDLE, \n",
    "* Thonny, \n",
    "* VS Code, \n",
    "* PyCharm, \n",
    "* Spyder, \n",
    "* etcetera, etcetera, etcetera...\n",
    "\n",
    "Which one should I choose?!?!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we'll use Jupyter notebooks (though we will occasionally give you a glimpse of other options).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a great option for a class like this for a couple of main reasons. First, the nature of Jupyter notebooks encourage short chunks of code (in code cells) interspersed with explanitory text (markdown cells). Moreover, when run, the code cells can produce output (such as data graphics) directly in the notebook. This makes Jupyter notebooks great for both teaching and learning coding, because both the code and the results can be presented and digested in small bites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, because \n",
    "\n",
    "* the markdown text and the code output are interweaved in a single document, and\n",
    "* this document can be output in a number of formats including pdf and html,\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks have become a defacto standard tool for data scientists. For small to intermediate sized projects, everything can be done a notebook or a small number of notebooks. For larger projects involving lots of complicated code, the projects itself can be done in something like VS Code or PyCharm, and results and summary can still be presented in Jupyter Notebooks simply by reusing the plotting code from the main project.\n",
    "\n",
    "More minor reasons include the simple easy-to-master interface and ready availability of help due to its ubiquity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, Jupyter notebooks provide us with an ideal jumping in point for learning Python and some fundementals of data science!"
