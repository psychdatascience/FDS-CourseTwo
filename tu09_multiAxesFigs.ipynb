    "We will often want to put multiple panels in a figure. In fact, take a look at the current issue of [Nature](https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?type=letter) (generally regarded as the top scientific journal in the world), and you will see *all* of the figures shown in the article listing have multiple panels. The reason is quite simply that, in general, there are multiple aspects of a single data set, experiment, etc., that tell a single story together. It is thus more effective to have these multiple aspects conveyed in a single figure so that the reader can appreciate these aspects and their interrelationships together."
