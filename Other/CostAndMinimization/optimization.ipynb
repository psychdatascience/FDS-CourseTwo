    "Let's get the intuition for optimization by looking at a machine learning algorithm that you probably didn't even know was a machine learning algorithm: good ol' linear regression!  \n",
    "You might be wondering \"How is linear regression a machine learning?\" Good question! You might think of machine learning algorithms as, for example, classifying pictures of your face from all the other pictues you have. The key is that the machine learning algorithm is *predicting* which faces should be your face, and *predicting* that the other photos aren't. In other words, it is looking at all the values of the pixels in the images, and predicting whether those pixel values - the **data** - are correspond to your face or some other face. Well, this is pretty much what a regression does. A regression takes input data (the x values) and then, for any x we can think of, it makes a *prediction* of what the corresponding y value should be! For example, if we know that average happiness in a country is related to the health of the economy in that country as measured by gross domestic prodect (GDP), then we can predict the average happiness in *any* country, even those countries whose data weren't in the initial regression line."
