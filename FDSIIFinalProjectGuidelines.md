### FDSII Final Project Guidelines

Work in groups of 2 or 3. Once you have your group, create a public GitHub repository for it. This way you can collaborate on writing the code. Having a GitHub repo to which everybody has contributed is a  requirement for the project.

#### Basic project types

* Analyze a publically available dataset to answer an interesting question or questions.
* Do a simulation of some phenomenon.

#### Analyzing an existing dataset (or sets)

The internet is full of datasets! As we have seen, we can copy and paste tables directly from, e.g., Wikipedia. There are also internet repositories of data. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) is a great one (you need to sign up for an account but it's free). The open-access journal [PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/recommended-repositories) has a list of recommended repositories. And there are many others.

As we've already seen in class, getting a dataset in shape for analysis can take a bit of work, and could easily take over half of the total time to do the project. (It's like painting a car or a house: the majority of time is spent cleaning and scraping and masking off the windows, etc., and then the actual painting goes really fast.) So deciding on a dataset and getting going on the data wrangling should get started early!

#### Simulation

Another route to go is to do a simulation project. Earlier in the class (and in FDS I), we did some simulations of elections. It might be interesting to, say, do a realistic simulation of the upcoming presidential election based on real polling and the real electoral college system. Or one could simulate the spread of a disease in a population depending on various behaviors of the population (rates of masking, social distancing, etc.). Or a sports tournament, a war-game, etc. If you have an idea for a simulation, but have no idea how to get started, let's chat!
