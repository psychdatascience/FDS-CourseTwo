    "A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal decision boundary that best separates the data into different classes. The key concept behind SVM is to maximize the \"margin\" (distance) between classes, which is defined as the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest data points from each class. These nearest points are called *support vectors*, and they determine the position and orientation of the boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM can handle both linearly separable and non-linearly separable data. For linearly separable data, the algorithm finds a straight-line boundary that best separates the classes. However, for non-linearly separable data, SVM uses a technique called the kernel trick. The kernel trick involves transforming the input data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable, allowing the SVM to find the optimal separating boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step overview of how SVM works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the optimal boundary: Find the boundary that best separates the classes by maximizing the margin between them. This is achieved by minimizing a cost function that considers both the margin size and the classification error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify support vectors: Find the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary, as they are critical in defining the optimal boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make predictions: For a new input data point, determine which side of the decision boundary it lies on.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and robustness against overfitting, making it suitable for various applications, including image classification, text categorization, and bioinformatics."

    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in machine learning, statistics, and data analysis to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much information as possible. The primary goal of PCA is to identify and project the data onto the most significant directions (principal components) in the feature space, where the variance of the data is maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the basic steps of PCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardization**: The first step is to standardize the dataset by scaling each feature to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that all features have equal importance in the analysis and prevents larger-scale features from dominating the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, it makes the data unit-independent by converting all the data to their Z-scores. This means that, for example, a questionaire with scores ranging from 0 to 100 won't be weighted more than a hormone measure that ranges from 0 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covariance Matrix**: PCA computes the covariance matrix of the standardized dataset, which captures the linear relationships between the features. The covariance matrix helps determine the directions in which the variance of the data is maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "This a fancy way of saying that we compute the correlation between all the variables. You can think of the covariance matrix as just a numerical version of a pair-pair plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The next step is to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors represent the directions of the principal components, while eigenvalues represent the magnitude of the variance along each principal component. The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue represents the direction with the highest variance, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the \"Eigenvalues\" as being proportional to \"variance explained\" or $R^2$ - if the first two, say, explain most of the variance, then we can safely use the first two principal components to do our categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Projection onto Principal Components**: Finally, the original dataset is projected onto the principal components (eigenvectors) to obtain the transformed data in the reduced-dimensional space. The number of principal components retained is typically determined by the desired level of variance preservation or the specific problem requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we just effectively re-plot our data with the first and second principal components are the x and y axes."

The classifier can thus use the probability density function of the Gaussian distribution to compute the likelihood of a feature value given a class label.\n",
