#### `INNER JOIN`

Up to now, we’ve been getting information from just one table. Getting stuff from one table is fine of course, but the point of a relational database is that information is stored across multiple tables in some systematic way. This implies that there must be some way to stitch relevant information across tables into a single view. There is! And the stitching is accomplished by using  `INNER JOIN`.
