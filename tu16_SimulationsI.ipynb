    "As a simple example, if NASA were working on a new two-stage rocket, they would need to know, for a given launch site, where the first stage is likely to land once it detaches and falls to earth. That information would be crucial, and no launch would be allowed without it. Of course, equations using Newtonian physics and aerodynamics can be used to predict an expected spot for impact. But, obviously, the discarded stage won't hit in that exact spot every time. So, what we really want is a *distribution*, like a 2D histogram, of likely landing spots. In other words, a map of the danger zone. To construct a map of the danger zone, we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a bunch of rockets and test-fire them into space, recording the impact coordinates of the fallen stage each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tinker with the constants in the equations (such as wind speed and direction at various altitudes) by hand, recording the impact coordinates predicted by the equations each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option would be incredibly tedious and would be subject to bias  (how would the exact wind directions be chosen?). The first option would expensive, time-consuming and, of course, incredibly dangerous. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a second example, consider forcasting the landfall of hurricanes. Here, it's obviously impossible to \"test fire\" a bunch of hurricanes and, even if we could, doing so would defeat the very purpose of forcasting the landfall! Very elaborate sets of equations can predict *a* landfall for a particular set of constants (ocean temperatures, prevailing winds, etc.) but, again, what we want is a *distribution* of likely locations for landfall – a map of the danger zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these situations, the solution is to run the equations on a computer – that is, to do a simulations – many many times over and, each time, having the computer select probable values for the constants (air temperature etc.) *at random*. Having the values for the constants be set to new random values each time will make the final outcome – impact site, landfall location, etc. – also vary, and the final distribution of these outcomes will give us the information we want.
