## Guidelines for FDS II final project deliverables

###  General

Anytime you are summarizing something for an audience, or supervisor, or whatever in either written or verbal from, it's best to have the following consistent structure:

* An introduction, in which you tell or remind your audience in lay terms what you are working on and why
* A description of what you did at an appropriate level of detail for the current audience
* A "show and tell" session describing what you found. Visuals are very important here. Put the visuals front and center and describe and summarize them in as though you were back in grade school playing show and tell.
* Conclusions or Summary. This is a summation of what you found and what it means. It can be as short as the "elevator ride" version of your project that you might give to a colleague. The take-home message.

### Presentation

Presentations will be given on the penultimate day of class, so we have last day of class if we run short on time.
