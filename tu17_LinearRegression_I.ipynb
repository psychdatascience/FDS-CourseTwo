    "## Linear regression is a fundamental concept in statistics and machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is important because it can help us to understand and predict the relationship between two or more variables. It is widely used in many fields such as economics, finance, engineering, and social sciences. For example, in finance, linear regression can be used to predict stock prices based on economic indicators. In engineering, it can be used to predict the strength of materials based on their composition. In social sciences, it can be used to understand the relationship between poverty and crime rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the term **linear** in Linear regression does not refer only to a line, but it applies to any polynomial! Linear here is referred to the parameters of the model and not the model *per se*!"
